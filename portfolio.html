									<h3>Analyse de Valeur : le Forum de l'Ingénierie Durable<br/>Value analysis : the sustainable engineering forum </h3>
								</header>

								<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic02.1.jpg" alt="" /></a>

								<p>The “Forum de l’Igénierie Durable” (FID) is a student association at the UTC that organized in March 2019 the first internship fair and raising awareness forum inviting environmentally friendly organizations with social ethics only. After this first successful event, the FID team received many comments and the members started to disagree on several questions such as:
								<br />“How can we know if an organization is environmentally friendly?
								<br />Should we invite deeply committed organizations only?” 
								<br />“What is our priority? Offering internships opportunities to UTC students or raising awareness on environment and social issues?” 
								<br />“How could we improve our internal organization?” 
								<br />“How could we expand our reach?”
								<br /> Etc.<br />
								The project FID Value Analysis was led by a multidisciplinary group of five engineer students in order to answer to those questions and propose improved visions of the FID event for a time horizon up to 2020 and 2030. The group acted as a consulting team working together with the association for five months, using tools like octopus diagram, FAST diagram, causal analysis...

									<h3>Urbanisme durable : le projet GOUTTE<br/>Sustainable urbanism : GOUTTE project</h3>
								</header>

								<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic03.1.jpg" alt="" /></a>

								<p>The topic given during the "Urbanism and Environment" course was as follow: “Imagine an urban engineering project, device or service that could help face social and environmental issues in the future”. The group of three students I was part of, chose to propose a way to entirely transform any European mid-sized city to drastically diminish its energy consumption, its CO2 emissions in the global scale as well as its urban spreading, using concepts such as compact city, car-less city, bioclimatic architecture, urban agriculture…
								The purpose of this project is to show a way to organize the city to modify our lifestyles in a much more sustainable way, even dough it is not feasible considering current construction rules and means. It is more like an imagination exercise than a real concept.

									<h3>Etude sur la rénovation thermique d'un quartier résidentiel de Compiègne<br/>Study on the thermal renovation of a residential neighborhood in Compiègne</h3>
								</header>

								<p>For the "Urban Thermics" course, we studied the impacts of the thermal renovation of a neighborhood for Compiègne's town hall. The goal of the project was to modelize the current buildings in order to calculate their energy gain and losses, then to modelize the necessary renovations to meet the requirements of the RT2012 standards, to estimate the costs of the renovation work and calculate the returns on investments based on the average income of households.
								<br/>We were four students working on the same neigborhood. First, we modelized the buildings with Autocad, then we imported this model in Heliodon and CitySIM in order to calculate their energy gains and losses due to gaography, solar rays and climate. In parellel, we modelized one typical house of the neighborhood in Pléiades so that we had precise thermal balance on this building, considering its materlials, its walls, floor and roof thickness, its ventilation and heating equipments... All the required information were provided by the town hall. The renovations were modelized by updating this unique model, and the costs and return on investment time were estimated based on the market prices and the locas public statistics on the population and accomodation. <br/>
								The conclusions of the study are presented on the poster attached below.
